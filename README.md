# Hello, world! I’m Mike ✌️🤘  

I build things. I break things. I make things better.  

## About Me  
I’m a software engineer with a passion for designing scalable systems, writing maintainable code, and learning how things work under the hood. **Professionaly**, I'm deep into the Microsoft ecosystem, architecting and implementing reliable and scalable financial systems that facilitate over $2.5B in new loans per year. **Personally**, I'm having the time of my life exploring how AI can be integrated into many aspects of life.

I enjoy working with modern architectures, automating repetitive tasks, and diving into complex problems that need creative solutions. I believe in **clean code, continuous learning, and sharing knowledge with others**.  

## What You'll Find Here  
🔹 Random scripts, utilities, and experiments.  
🔹 Open-source contributions and side projects.  
🔹 Things I build when I should be doing something else.  

## Rabbit Holes I'm Currently Exploring
🌿 **Express.js + Node.js** – Stepping into the JavaScript backend world and digging into the ecosystem.  
🐍 **Python** – Interested in its potential for backend services, automation, and ML applications. Have used it in the past mainly for Django development and scripting.  
🤖 **AI All the Things** – Experimenting with AI integrations, LLMs, and learning where it fits into life.  
ʕ◔ϖ◔ʔ **Go** - Just dipping my toes in on this one.  
🐦 **Swift** - Who doesn't want to make apps for their own phone?
